# ContactsAppLetterScrollAppleClone

This repository serves as a proof of concept for the [DragGestureKit library](https://github.com/Harry-KNIGHT/DragGestureKit). The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the functionality of DragGestureKit with a simplified clone of the Apple Contacts app.

# Overview

The primary goal of this clone is to provide clear and concise examples of how to integrate DragGestureKit into a SwiftUI project. The implementation mimics the Apple Contacts app's letter scroll feature, allowing users to quickly navigate through a list of contacts using an alphabetical scroll.
